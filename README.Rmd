# shewhart4hrms

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A package for automated processing of LC-HRMS data to record intensity, retention time, mass accuracy and peak width of user defined internal standards. The data is displayed in the form of Shewhart control charts and density distributions along with user defined warning limits for quick visual indication of exceedances.

## Installation of shewhart4hrms

R version 4.4.2 and ntsworkflow are required (see https://github.com/bafg-bund/ntsworkflow).

On Windows 10, the compiled package archive `shewhart4hrms_*.*.zip` can then be installed through the R-GUI menu 
"Packages" => "Install packages from local files..." or through the RStudio menu "Tools" => "Install Packages..." 
=> "Install from" => "Package archive file". The compiled archive can be found on the BfG FTP 
server: `ftp.bafg.de/pub/REFERATE/g2/shewhart4hrms/`

Alternatively, you can compile the package for your system using the `devtools` package and the source code.
Only Windows 10 has been tested so far.

## Usage

A local directory tree to hold the raw data, settings and processing results is created first. The directory can be 
given any name. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shewhart4hrms::newDirTree("~/linsensuppe")
```

In this directory there are sub-directories `mzXML-data-files`, `results` and `settings`.

The subdirectory `settings` contains two `is-table-*.csv` files which lists the internal standards you are using
(separated for positive and negative ionization). Example tables are provided. You must provide a name, formula, retention time and 
adduct for each internal standard. See the example files for the formating. For example, deuterium atoms are indicated
with [space]2H. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(read.csv("inst/example-settings/is-table-pos.csv"), caption = "Example is-table-pos.csv file")
```

The `settings/processingSettings.yml` file contains all settings for measurement file processing. This is a Yaml formatted
text file best viewed with Rstudio or notepad++. For more information on Yaml see [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/). Some 
default values used on a Sciex 6600 are already filled in but these will most likely be very different depending on the
mass spectrometer. Especially the `area_threshold_*` parameter may be as high as 1e6 depending on the mass spectrometer used.

Example processingSettings.yml file
```yaml
# Settings file for shewhart4hrms ##############################################
# Processing settings ##########################################################

# mz_tol and eic_extraction width in Da
# rt_tol in min
# area_threshold in counts

# pos 
file_pattern_pos: .*pos.*
mz_tol_pos: 0.005
rt_tol_pos: 0.5
area_threshold_pos: 1
eic_extraction_width_pos: 0.04

# neg
file_pattern_neg: .*neg.*
mz_tol_neg: 0.005
rt_tol_neg: 0.5
area_threshold_neg: 1
eic_extraction_width_neg: 0.04
```

In the `settings/warningLevels.csv` file the user can specify where warning levels are to be drawn on the plots. The name of the
internal standard is given under name_is and must match the name given in the `is-table-*.csv`. The parameter name must
match the parameter name displayed in the app. Missing values are left empty.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
knitr::kable(read.csv("inst/example-settings/warningLevels.csv"), caption = "Example warningLevels.csv")
```

You must first copy the mzXML files of your measurements into the `mzXML-data-files` sub-directory. For conversion to
mzXML use [Proteowizard](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io). Each file must be an LC-ESI-HRMS measurement of the 
defined internal standards (see "settings"). The file name must contain either "pos" or "neg" to indicate the polarity.

Once you have your first mzXML files copied into `mzXML-data-files` (both pos and neg files are needed) and an initial 
guess at the appropriate integration parameters has been set, the processing can be initiated. 

Start the app by running:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
shewhart4hrms::viewShewhart("~/linsensuppe")
```
The shiny interface should open in your browser.

Click "Refresh" to start the processing. The results of the peak integration, if successful, will be stored in the 
`results` directory and the plots should be updated. To restart the processing delete the `results_*.csv` file.

New files can be copied into the `mzXML-data-files` at any time and clicking "Refresh" in the shiny window will process
the new files.

To start the shiny interface directly in Windows you can use a `.bat` file. An example file is provided in the 
directory you created, and should work as-is regardless of where it is placed on the system.
